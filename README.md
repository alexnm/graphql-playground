# GraphQL React+Node Full Stack example
Proof of concept for graphql with react and express. Highlighting all the major GraphQL features including Mutations and Subscriptions.

## Usage

Clone the repo. You then need two separate terminals for the backend and frontend.

In one terminal we start the `express` server:
```
cd graphql-express
npm i
npm start
```

In the other we start the `react` frontend:
```
cd graphql-react
npm i
npm start
```

The backend runs on `localhost:4000` while the frontend is on `localhost:3000`.
